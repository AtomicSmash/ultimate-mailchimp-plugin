# Ultimate MailChimp Plugin - v0.0.1
## WooCommerce MailChimp signups
### This plugin may break your site ðŸ’€ or even MailChimp account ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. Please only use in development environments.

## What does this plugin actually do?

On almost all of the WordPress sites that [Atomic Smash](https://www.atomicsmash.co.uk) create and maintain, we do some form of MailChimp syncing. **Most** existing plugins rely on the need to record information within WP to then sync with MailChimp at a later point.

We found this can become very cumbersome. List members are able to interact with MailChimp outside of the website via the list communication preferences (or even by just unsubscribing from the list). This boils down to a member being able to change there details without your WP site being involved. Of course, you can setup webhooks to notify your site when a change is made via MailChimp blah blah blah... **BUT**... **Just keep it simple**. Maintain MailChimp as the 'single source of truth' and forgot about needing to keep subscription preferences in line with the WP site.

#### Data cleanliness

Thanks to this separation, WordPress and MailChimp are completable replaceable in the future.
- If you need to move to a new CMS, everything is inside MailChimp already.
- If you need to move away from MailChimp, just export from MailChimp. There are no user artefacts within your Wordpress site regarding user communication preferences.

#### When does this plugin talk to MailChimp?

This plugin communicates with MailChimp at these points:

- Successful order via WooCommerce. - `woocommerce_checkout_update_order_meta`

**More points of interaction will be added in the future.**

Know of another time you would like to talk to MailChimp? Please add an issue!

## Complete site setup

### Step 1 - Add configs

Add these config details to your `wp-config.php`

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID', '');
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY', '');
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_GDPR_FIELDS', true);
```

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID` - This is the list you would sync with. This can be [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636310/43076416-18e63d42-8e7c-11e8-907d-03074ba6879a.gif).

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` - This is your key can be found in your account.

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_GDPR_FIELDS` -

### Step 2 - Enable double opt-in in your MailChimp list (encouraged)

By default, when someone checks the "Sign me up to the MailChimp newsletter", the subscriber status is set to 'pending'. This will trigger a confirmation email from MailChimp.

To make sure this functionality works. Go to your list > Settings > 'List name and campaign' and check the "Enable double opt-in" checkbox and save. [Like this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636310/43076417-1901cf3a-8e7c-11e8-8a8f-c5f0e63a0ff7.gif).

If you would like to disable the double opt-in and force the user to be subscribed on sync, add this constant to your config and set to `false`.

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DOUBLE_OPTIN', false);
```

### Step 3 - GDPR fields

MailChimp have added a series of 'marketing permission' (GDPR) fields to it's API. To be able to interact with these, we need a few pieces of information.

- Field ID
- Field Name
- Field value (whether it should be checked or not)


### Other Config

Here are some extra config options. We would recommend only using these in a development or testing environment.

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LOGGING', true);
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DEBUG', true);
```

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LOGGING` - This enables logging to the file: `wp-content/uploads/ultimate-mailchimp.log` via monolog.

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DEBUG` - When in debug mode, WooCommerce checkout will not complete (There will be a JSON error) yet MailChimp will be called. This allows you to run through the checkout process without having to create a new order each time.


## Merge fields

These merge fields are sent by default are:

```
**FNAME** - This is taken from the first name in the billing details.
**LNAME** - This is taken from the last name in the billing details.
```

To edit the merge fields sent to MailChimp, use the [merge field filter here](https://github.com/AtomicSmash/ultimate-mailchimp-plugin/wiki/Filters).
