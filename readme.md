# Ultimate MailChimp Plugin - v0.0.1
## WooCommerce MailChimp signups
### This plugin may break your site ðŸ’€ or MailChimp account ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. Please only use in development environments.

### Plugin functionality

No record of the whether the user is subscribed to MailChimp is actually stored inside WordPress. When a user completes a transaction an API call is fired to MailChimp to send this information. We usually find if the user's MailChimp subscription status is stored somewhere that isn't MailChimp itself, then a method of syncing needs to be created and maintained. So we kept it simple and removed this requirement.

### Subscription signup on WooCommerce purchase

Users will be presented with a description of MailChimp as a marketing platform and a WooCommerce checkbox to confirm subscription status.

All of this text in editable via the available via [these filters](https://github.com/AtomicSmash/ultimate-mailchimp-plugin/wiki/Filters). ðŸ˜Ž

### Transactional data

Currently, this plugin doesn't handle syncing of transactional data. It **will** in the future.

## Features

- GDPR compliant newsletter description built in

## Merge fields

These merge fields are sent by default are:

```
**FNAME** - This is taken from the first name in the billing details.
**LNAME** - This is taken from the last name in the billing details.
```

## When do user details get sent to MailChimp?

The plugin hooks into these actions to update MailChimp:

- `woocommerce_checkout_update_order_meta`:  This is fired after a successful order via WooCommerce.

## Setup

### Step 1 - Turn on WooCommerce terms and conditions

We have bundled this notice with the native 'Terms and conditions' block due to the opt-in process being inherently linked. So for the MailChimp block to appear, there needs to be a 'Terms and conditions' page set inside WooCommerce.

Go to `your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout` and make sure a 'terms and conditions' page is set.

### Step 2 - Add configs

Add these config details to your `wp-config.php`

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID', '');
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY', '');
```

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID` - This is the list you would sync with. This can be [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636310/43076416-18e63d42-8e7c-11e8-907d-03074ba6879a.gif).

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` - This is your key can be found in your account.

### Step 3 - Configure opt-in (encouraged)

By default, when someone checks the "Sign me up to the MailChimp newsletter", the subscriber status is set to 'pending'. This will trigger a confirmation email from MailChimp.

To make sure this functionality works. Go to your list > Settings > 'List name and campaign' and check the "Enable double opt-in" checkbox and save. [Like this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636310/43076417-1901cf3a-8e7c-11e8-8a8f-c5f0e63a0ff7.gif).

If you would like to disable the double opt-in and force the user to be subscribed on sync, add this constant to your config and set to `false`.

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DOUBLE_OPTIN', false);
```

### Bonus Config

Here are some extra config options. We would recommend only using these in a development or testing enviroment.

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LOGGING', true);
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DEBUG', true);
```

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LOGGING` - This enables logging to the file: `wp-content/uploads/ultimate-mailchimp.log`

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DEBUG` - When in debug mode, WooCommerce checkout will not complete (There will be a JSON error) yet MailChimp will be called. This allows you to run through the checkout process without having to create a new order each time.
