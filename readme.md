# Ultimate MailChimp Plugin - v0.0.1
## WooCommerce MailChimp signups
### This plugin may break your site ðŸ’€ or even MailChimp account ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. Please only use in development environments.

## What does this plugin actually do?

On almost all of the WordPress sites that [Atomic Smash](https://www.atomicsmash.co.uk) makes, we do some form of MailChimp syncing. **Most** existing plugins rely on the need to record information within WP to then sync with MailChimp at a later point.

We found this can become very cumbersome. List members may be able to interact with MailChimp from inside your site **OR** via the list communication preferences. This boils down to a member being able to unsubscribe without your WP site being involved. Of course, you can setup webhooks to notify your site when a change is made via MailChimp blah blah blah... **Keep it simple**, maintain MailChimp as the 'single source of truth' and forgot about needing to keep subscription preferences in line with the WP site.

#### Data cleanliness

Thanks to this separation, WordPress and MailChimp are completable replaceable in the future. 
- If you need to move to a new CMS, everything is inside MailChimp all ready
- If you need to move away from MailChimp, just export from MailChimp. There are no user artifacts on within Wordpress regarding their communication preferences.


#### When does this plugin talk to MailChimp

This plugin communicates with MailChimp when a user completes a WooCommerce transaction. Specifically this hook:

- `woocommerce_checkout_update_order_meta`:  This is fired after a successful order via WooCommerce.

**More points of interaction will be added in the future.**


### Subscription signup on WooCommerce purchase

Users will be presented with a description of MailChimp as a marketing platform and a WooCommerce checkbox to confirm subscription status.

All of this text in editable via the available via [these filters](https://github.com/AtomicSmash/ultimate-mailchimp-plugin/wiki/Filters). ðŸ˜Ž


## Features

- GDPR compliant newsletter description built in
- Send custom merge fields to MailChimp

## Upcoming features

- Currently, this plugin doesn't handle syncing of transactional data. It **will** in the future.


## Complete site setup

### Step 1 - Turn on WooCommerce terms and conditions

We have bundled this notice with the native 'Terms and conditions' block due to the opt-in process being inherently linked. So for the MailChimp block to appear, there needs to be a 'Terms and conditions' page set inside WooCommerce.

Go to `your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout` and make sure a 'terms and conditions' page is set.

### Step 2 - Add configs

Add these config details to your `wp-config.php`

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID', '');
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY', '');
```

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID` - This is the list you would sync with. This can be [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636310/43076416-18e63d42-8e7c-11e8-907d-03074ba6879a.gif).

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` - This is your key can be found in your account.

### Step 3 - Enable double opt-in (encouraged)

By default, when someone checks the "Sign me up to the MailChimp newsletter", the subscriber status is set to 'pending'. This will trigger a confirmation email from MailChimp.

To make sure this functionality works. Go to your list > Settings > 'List name and campaign' and check the "Enable double opt-in" checkbox and save. [Like this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1636310/43076417-1901cf3a-8e7c-11e8-8a8f-c5f0e63a0ff7.gif).

If you would like to disable the double opt-in and force the user to be subscribed on sync, add this constant to your config and set to `false`.

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DOUBLE_OPTIN', false);
```

### Step 4 - GDPR fields

MailChimp have added a series of 'marketing permission' (GDPR) fields to it's API. To be able to interact with these, we need a few pieces of information.

- Field ID
- Field Name
- Field value (whether it should be checked or not)



### Other Config

Here are some extra config options. We would recommend only using these in a development or testing enviroment.

```
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LOGGING', true);
define('ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DEBUG', true);
```

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_LOGGING` - This enables logging to the file: `wp-content/uploads/ultimate-mailchimp.log`

`ULTIMATE_MAILCHIMP_DEBUG` - When in debug mode, WooCommerce checkout will not complete (There will be a JSON error) yet MailChimp will be called. This allows you to run through the checkout process without having to create a new order each time.


## Merge fields

These merge fields are sent by default are:

```
**FNAME** - This is taken from the first name in the billing details.
**LNAME** - This is taken from the last name in the billing details.
```

To edit the merge fields sent to MailChimp, use the [merge field filter here](https://github.com/AtomicSmash/ultimate-mailchimp-plugin/wiki/Filters).
